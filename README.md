# Astro Quiz Plugin

This is just an experiment!

## Repository Structure

The source is built using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Look at [Astro documentation](https://github.com/withastro/astro) for more!

## 🧞 Developing

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command        | Action                                       |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn`         | Installs dependencies                        |
| `yarn dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `yarn build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `yarn preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |
